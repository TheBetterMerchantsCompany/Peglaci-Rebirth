    "The most important thing is to stay calm. The Artifacts are of great value, but they are also almost indestructible - you won't be breaking them by accident, don't worry. If you encounter them, return them to a Peacekeeper outpost for a finder's fee. ",
	
	"Alternately, you may wish to try to use them yourself. You are hereby authorized to try, but we would suggest you be very cautious. Some Peglaci settlements contain a Giant altar - you may have the most luck if you start there."

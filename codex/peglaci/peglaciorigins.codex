    "Other races may seek for ages the mystery of their origins. Not so for the Peglaci - we alone know our creators.",

	"In our distant past, the Peglaci were an apex carnivore, hunting - and being hunted by - the whales that were their chief source of food. They scarcely had tool-use, and gathered themselves in hunting bands, raiding other groups and running off with their young.",

	"One day, a great light came upon our ancestors, and they felt themselves change inside - the influence of the Giants, our creators and parents to us all. Over scant millenia, the Giants guided our species from savagery into civilization, spurning our worship and instilling in us the knowledge that we could be as them, one day.",

	"The Giants answered what questions we thought to ask, seemingly proud that we sought to push ourselves forwards, and ever willing to help us advance. They asked nothing of us in return - what could we give a race such as theirs? Even so, we strove to live up to their intentions for us, however murky they may have seemed.",

    "All at once, they left us. Whether they ascended beyond this realm, having accomplished their goals, or merely died off, we know not. All they left us were their artifacts, their databanks, and their belief in tolerance and justice.",

	"As Peacekeepers, we strive to make the galaxy a better place for all beings, as they would have wanted."
